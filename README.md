# Bookmark Pages TYPO3 Extension

__Important notice:__ This is a fork of the original [colorcube/bookmark_pages](https://github.com/colorcube/bookmark_pages) extension to adjust the bookmarking functionalities for our own needs.

This is a TYPO3 extension that provides bookmarks functionality of local pages for logged in frontend users.

## Usage

TypoScript and fluid templates are just examples. Adapt it to your needs.

In the example templates there's nothing shown if the user is not logged in.
